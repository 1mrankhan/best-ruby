This repository aims to help everyone to write a more idiomatic, clean and tricky ruby code and also try to join a bunch of good refactoring techniques. You can add your own technique or paste it from some website(do not forget the source, of course). All the tricks are in the /tricks folder.

For the sake of reading, you should paste in the markdown format and at the end, paste where the technique come from, if it's not yours.

## [Tricks](tricks.md)

In this part we can check some obscure or awesome features from the and the standard ruby library which normally we forget.

## [Idiomatic Ruby](idiomatic_ruby.md)

You can write a Ruby code, but it can look like a Java code for example. Here you can find some tips to write a more natural and take advantage of Ruby.

## [Refactorings](refactorings.md)

Small (and big) improvements you can apply to your code and improve it's readability and maintenance. Change the internal structure of the code without changing it's behaviour.

## [Best Practices](best_practices.md)

If you keep your house cleaned constantly you'll never need to waste a weekend cleaning it. The same applys to your code, be disciplined and keep your code looking good with those tips.
